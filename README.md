## Marco Leonardi (2015)
Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data this paper shows that more educated workers demand more high-skill-intensive services (such as education services, medical, and professional services) and, to a lower extent, more very low-skill-intensive services (such as personal services). The positive (and J-shaped) relationship between the education (and income) elasticities and the skill-intensity of consumption goods and services is evident in the United States. The parametrization of a simple two-sector model suggests that overall the income and education effects in favor of skill-intensive goods and services can explain around 6.5 percent of the total increase in the college premium in the United States from 1984 to 2002.

## Replication
 This repository contains the replication of the main results of the evidence from the United States.

The right sequence of files to run to replicate the US results:

 - Data cleaning file [here](link)
 - Estimates of Education and Income Elasticities [(Table 1)](link)
 - Plot of education elasticities against skill intensity, together with a linear and a quadratic fit obtained by a OLS regression weighted by the mean expenditure share of each consumption item (a measure of the importance of the item in the household budget) [(Figure 1)](link)
 - Results of the linear weighted regression of estimated education and income elasticities on two measures of skill intensity [(Table 2)](link)
 - Table of education elasticities by family type [(Table 3 Panel A)](link)
 - Table of education elasticities estimated over time [(Table 3 Panel B)](link)
 - Calculations to quantify overall income and education effects: parameters of the model [(Table 5)](link) and quantification of the income and education effects [(Table 6)](link)
